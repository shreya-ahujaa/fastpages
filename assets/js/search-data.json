            "content": "2D Arrays . Creating a 2D Array . The first step is to initialize the array To do this, specify the type, followed by &quot;[][]&quot;, followed by the name of the 2D array. | . | . int[][] numbers; String[][] names; char[][] letters; float[][] floats; double[][] doubles; Object[][] objects; . Initializing a 2D Array . Then you must give it a value, by initializing the 2D array | There are two ways to initialize a 2D array Method 1: You can initialize the array by giving it values | Method 2: You can also initialize it by giving it the size | . | . Iteration . To iterate through a normal array, you would could use a for loop, as demonstrated below to print the alphabet | You would iterate through the first array(row), then use another for loop nested within the first that iterates through the second arrays(columns). | . String[][] alphabet = {{&quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, &quot;4&quot;, &quot;5&quot;, &quot;6&quot;, &quot;7&quot;, &quot;8&quot;, &quot;9&quot;, &quot;0&quot;, &quot;-&quot;, &quot;=&quot;}, {&quot;q&quot;, &quot;w&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, &quot;r&quot;, &quot;t&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;u&quot;, &quot;i&quot;, &quot;o&quot;, &quot;p&quot;, &quot;[&quot;, &quot;]&quot;, &quot; &quot;}, {&quot;a&quot;, &quot;s&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, &quot;f&quot;, &quot;g&quot;, &quot;h&quot;, &quot;j&quot;, &quot;k&quot;, &quot;l&quot;}, {&quot;z&quot;, &quot;x&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;v&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;n&quot;, &quot;m&quot;, &quot;,&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, &quot;/&quot;}}; for(int i = 0;i&lt;alphabet.length;i++){ for(int j = 0; j &lt; alphabet[i].length;j++){ //nested for loops System.out.print(alphabet[i][j]+&quot; &quot;); } System.out.println(&quot; &quot;); } . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 - = q w e r t y u i o p [ ] a s d f g h j k l z x c v b n m , . / .

Inheritance . method to create a hierarchy between classes by inheriting from other classes | Extends is what allows you to bring those attributes from one class to another example: fibonacci code | . | . . . Subclass . A subclass inherits all the members from the superclass while the constructor of the superclass can be invoked from the subclass | Super keyword refers to superclass objects; it is used to call superclass methods and to access the superclass constructor | . Abstract Class and Method . Abstract Class: can not be instantiated by they can be subclassed | Abstract Method: a method that has the method definition but no implementation | . Standard Methods . Standard methods are blocks of code that can be called from another location in the program or class toString(); returns the given value in string format | equals(); compares two strings and returns true if the strings are equal | hashCode(); returns an integer value generated by a hashing algorithm | . | . Polymorphism . Polymorphism: the ability of a class to provide different implementations of a method depending on the type of object that is passed to the method | allows us to perform the same action in many different ways | . Big O Notation . Big O notation describes the set of all algorithms that run no worse than a certain speed, no better than a certain speed, and at a certain speed Shows the number of operations it will perform | . | . .",

            "content": "Collegeboard Score: 46/52 (88.4%) . General Reflection . My final score was 46/52 which I was pretty happy with, even though it was lower than last time. Although I got a good score, I believe that I need to get better with my timing on these assessments. I have been taking too much time trying to understand the questions and find the correct answer, but I will not have this much time on the AP Exam. I found some of these problems more challenging than the previous tests, which may have been why I got a lower score. I think I need to practice more of these concepts more thoroughly before the AP Exam. . AP College Board 52 Question Test Corrections . Question 7 The correct answer choice would be B. The combine method compares corresponding substrings of length 1 from input strings one and two. If the substrings are the same, the substring is appended to res; otherwise, “0” is appended to res. The first and second characters of res are “0” because the characters in position 0 and the characters in position 1 of one and two differ. The third character of res is “1” because the characters in position 2 of one and two are both “1”. The fourth character in res is “0” because the characters in position 3 of one and two differ. The fifth character in res is “0” because the last characters of one and two are both “0”. Therefore, the value of 00100 is returned rather than the 00101 that I had chosen. | . | Question 19 In this question, the for loop assigns values to k from 0 to the last possible position in str at which check could appear, inclusive. In the body of the loop, the String a is assigned a substring of check that starts at position k and has the same length as check. If the substring a and check are the same, num is assigned k. When the for loop ends, num has the last value of k at which a match between the substring a and check was found or the index of the last occurrence of check in str. This would mean that the correct answer is C instead of B. | . | Question 31 My answer was incorrect because code segment uses k, an element of the two-dimensional array, as an index in a one-dimensional array. The correct answer would have been D because it correctly shows that the outer for loop stores each row of the two-dimensional array in j, a one-dimensional array. The inner for loop stores each element of j in k and prints k. | . | Question 33 The answer to the question is A, but I chose B. A is the correct answer because the outer for loop iterates over every row of numbers and assigns each row to the array row. The inner loop iterates over the array row accessing each element and assigning it to n. Then n is printed to the screen. In the first iteration of the outer loop, row is equal to {1, 2, 3}, and the inner loop will assign each successive value in row to n and print it to the screen, meaning 123 will be printed. For the second iteration of the outer loop, row is equal to {4, 5, 6}, and the inner loop will assign each successive value in row to n and print it to the screen, meaning 456 will be printed after 123, giving us the output 123456. In the other one, there is no element at Row 3, so it would not work. | . | Question 42 The code segment that I chose was wrong. After executing the values mystery (values), the list should have the values of [0,4,2,5,3]. But, the answer I chose said that it would include [4,2,5,3] which is not correct.I missed something in the code, but understand why the answer should be D now. | . | Question 44 The method assigns the shortest string that occurs in any element of arr between arr[n] and arr[arr.length - 1], inclusive, to result[n]. The shortest string found between arr[0] and arr[3] is “of”, so result[0] is assigned the value “of”. The shortest string found between arr[1] and arr[3] is also “of”, so result[1] is also assigned the value “of”. The same is true for the part of the array that begins at index 2 and ends at index 3, so result[2] is also assigned the value “of”. In the last iteration of the outer for loop, there are no values to consider after arr[3], so result[3] is assigned the value “spring”. This would mean the answer should be D, but I chose C which would be wrong. | . | .",

This would be in range for the 5 on the AP Exam, but I do need to get better with my timing. For the actual AP Exam, I will need to answer questions at a must faster pace, which might my score lower if I do not practice with a time restriction. I thought that this test helped me in better understanding DeMorgans Laws, as there were many questions on that. I found these types of problems and some other ones challenging as I had to look at each answer option to make sure I was choosing the correct one, but I think I will get faster with more practice. Overall, this exam helped me get exposed to many types of problems, but I could work on my pacing and making sure to look at the question carefully. . AP College Board 66 MC Test Corrections . Question 19 In the answer choice that I chose, the expressions are not equivalent when a has the value 4, b has the value 3, c has the value 2, and d has the value 1. After looking at the problem more carefully, I realized that c &lt; d for the code segment to work. If c is greater than or equal to then this statement wouldn’t be equivalent to the one given. Therefore, my answer would be wrong and A would be correct. | . | Question 35 My answer was incorrect because the original code segment prints 10. The option that I chose causes the code segment to result in 11. The loop executes the same number of times as in the original code segment, but the initial value of count is 1. This would mean that D. | . | Question 43 When I was doing the test, I thought that both implementations worked as intended, but the only different could be that the first one would allow the result to come faster. However, once I looked at the problem again I realized that the implementation doesn’t work because it would cause an out of bounds exception (sum[j-1] in the first iteration would be sum[-1] which is not right. This would then mean that in order for the code segment to work, D would be the correct answer. | . | Question 58 My answer was incorrect because pos should be equal j because each iteration you don’t want the index to be reset back to 0. In other words, it would not make sense for the position to be reset to the 0th index every time the sorting method takes place. I did not think about this when I was first taking the test, but with this knowledge, the correct answer would be B. | . | Question 64 In Code Segments 1, the code does not print the array elements in order from left to right using an enhanced for loop. Code segment I uses elements as indices. The first element of arr is 1, and arr[1] is 2; the second element is 2, and arr[2] is 4; the third element is 4, and arr[4] is 3; etc. Option 3 is the only one that allows the given code segment to print the array elements in order from left to right using an enhanced for loop | . | .",

They also explained some key factors to being successful in the tech world and how we can organize and shift our lives to become content with where we end up in life. . Kathyleen Beveridge first started by explaining her career and journey. She has moved around and gone to many different jobs like Wells Fargo, Nikko Securities, Qualcomm, and is now ThermoFischer. At her job right now, she is the senior director of marketing, and helps market the different products and services for the tech companies in the right markets in order for them to benefit the people the most. While working in these industries, she learned many different things and was willing to share them with us. One thing that she believes is that the most important skill to the tech industry is adaptability. She claims that the best technical people listen to the requirements, translate it in terms of how technology can solve problems, and are flexible in helping people around them. This can be translated to our classroom. People who are more flexible and are willing to help those around them become more successful as they learn more by helping. This is something that I hope to do more in class from now on. Beveridge lives by the motto, “My mission in life is not merely to survive, but to thrive; and to do so with passion, some compassion, some humor, and style.” She is grateful that she is able to work and make a life in the industry that uses tech for the good of the people, and is proud of where she has come in life. I also hope to achieve something like this in my future, and end up somewhere where I am content and happy. . Kris Porter, the other guest speaker at the event also shared many insights with the class that will be useful in our journey through the technical field. He is a software developer and works as an SRE, DevOps Engineer, and Infrastructure Engineer. Throughout his career, he has also worked at multiple companies and has been successful in each one. One of the things that he believes to be most important in developing a working team is Agile Methodologies. He shows how different companies have their own version of agile development, and use it depending on what they need. But, all companies use it, helping the team work cohesively, which is something that my team has been emphasizing this trimester. Porter also shows us that continuous learning is key. He claims that it is important to not learn just a particular programming language, but to learn everything. I think this is something we do well in this class, as we don’t only focus on coding, but the different aspects like problem solving, and adding on with new techniques. The biggest takeaway from his talk was that coding is a way of thinking. It is a way of looking at a problem and dissecting it through critical thinking and problem solving. I think this is a very important mindset to have, and I hope I can continue to keep this learning mindset through Computer Science .",

Superclasses and subclasses are generally organized into a single root tree structure called an inheritance hierarchy In this type of hierarchy, attributes and methods that are associated with a specific class are inherited by lower levels of the hierarchy. | . | When working with a hierarchy of subclasses and superclasses, the object type and reference type can be different when instantiating an object variable. Example: Fruit fruit1 = new Apple(); In this case, the reference type is declared with the superclass, while the object type is declared with the subclass. | . | . Polymorphism . Polymorphism can be used when we have multiple classes that are related by inheritance It is utilized when a method is implemented to perform different tasks in different classes | essentially allows a method to take on multiple “forms” or implementations based on the specific object it is acting upon. | . | Polymorphism is useful for code reusability, as it re-implements an existing class’s attributes and methods for new classes real life example: a sport can take on different forms, as it can be soccer, basketball, baseball, etc. | . | . Object Superclass . The object superclass is located at the top of every class hierarchy this means all of the other classes in a hierarchy can use the attributes and methods of the object superclass through inheritance | It is a part of the built-in java.lang package. | . | The object superclass contains common, useful methods such as equals() and toString() The equals() method compares two objects; it is often used to check for equality between 2 String objects, comparing each character of both strings to check if they are the same. | The toString() method returns a String representation of a given object. | . | .

            "content": "Overall Reflection/Takeaways . Overall, there was a lot to takeaway from this trimester. I learned a lot through the units of Collegeboard and the Project Based Learning and I think my team and I worked well together. We each had our own part, for example, I was the Scrum Master, but I think we did well in making sure we did all the parts. For next trimester, I think I could have better time management so that I can do the requirements and go above and beyond. . Project Based Learning . PBL was a really good experience especially in understanding what is necessary for a website that would work well. I worked a lot as the Scrum Master, and I also helped with the Frontend so that I could learn the different aspects of code. Also I worked with the Backend during the individual sections so that I would learn that as well. . Fastpages . Learning Fastpages helped develop my ability to blog my learning and developments. Fastpages itself was generally very easy to use to develop requiring the creation of notebooks or html/md files. It helped with taking notes and I think it was a good way to manage my code and notes at the same time. . AWS . I thought learning how to use AWS was the most challenging for me. I learned how to do it through deploying my own website, and then when we assigned a AWS Manger (Aadya) then I had not done as much. Maybe next trimester I would be able to do more for AWS and deployment. . Notes Throughout the Trimester . Psychology Notes . Key Ideas from Video . We think life&#39;s circumstances matter a lot, but they don&#39;t matter as much as we think people do not think as much as we do | things like where we live, and what job we have do not matter in our happiness levels | people who focus on having money are oftentimes not happy later when they do have money | what we predict is going to make us happy, doesn&#39;t usually make us happy | . | Taking control of our life is oftentimes much harder than we think you can become happier, but it takes daily work and a lot of effort | &quot;It may be obvious that to achieve anything substantial in life, a good deal of effort is required. Research reveals that if you want to achieve happiness, you will need to go about it in a similar way&quot; | . | One of the hard you have to do when you begin this enterprise, is recognizing your intuition don&#39;t work your mind is lying to you a lot of the time | we can forecast things that are going to make us happy, and usually it does not make us as happy as we assume | one example of this: money and salary | . | Make time for social connection having a healthy mental health is very important | in order to do so, we should find time to have social connections with others | prioritize people that you care about in life | . | Always help others in any situation helping others help us more than we expect | very happy people give their time to others (much more powerful that doing things for yourself) | for example: instead of spending money for themselves, give it to other people | . | Make time for gratitude simple act of doing this is very powerful | think of the positives rather than focusing on the negatives of life | focus on the benefits (force yourself to do this --&gt; will make you happier) | write down everyday everything you are grateful for | . | Healthy practices matter a lot more than we think experiencing gratitude | be mindful in the moment (meditation) | taking time for sleep and exercise | . | It is very important to take time to be in the present moment most of us have trouble with this because we do not have time to realize that we are here | we do not think of all the small details about where we are, we do not live in the moment | . | .

            "content": "Collegeboard Score: 36/40 . General Reflection . My final score was 36/40 which I was fine with because it was in the range for a 5 on the AP Exam. However, I think the main thing I’ll need to work on is timing because it took me a while to complete it. I would not have that much time on the AP Exam, so I need to speed up. In future practices, I think I’ll just need to focus on timing and getting myself to answer and comprehend questions faster. . AP College Board Test Corrections . Question 14 In the answer that I choose, the ahe access being was what would be used if myVehicles was an array instead of an ArrayList and v was an index of the myVehicles array. However, in this case an enhanced for loop is being used, which accesses the elements of myVehicles directly and assigns v the value of the elements. So, that would mean the right answer is E (v.getMileage()) which will correctly return the mileage for v. | . | Question 18 My answer was incorrect because using this statement will result in a range between -1 and myList.size() – 2, which is not correct. Instead, the answer should have been B which is the right choice because the indices for myList are 0 through myList.size() – 1, for a total of myList.size() elements. | . | Question 33 When I was doing the test, I forgot to notice that k was never incremented. Since k is never incremented, the or (||) will always be true since k will always be less than 4 and an infinite loop will occur. Therefore, the answer E would be correct as there would be no output with an infinite loop. | . | Question 34 In my answer, I put that both Choice II and III would be correct. But, I later realized that III would not be correct because it attempts to update x and y, however since they are private instance variables in Point, they are not able to be accessed directly in Circle. Therefore, only II would be the correct choice to allow the code to run successfully, meaning that B was the correct MC answer. | . | .",

A list is considered strictly increasing if each element after the first is greater than (but not equal to) the preceding element. . public boolean isStrictlyIncreasing(){ for(int i = 1; i &lt; digitList.size(); i++){ // iterate through the digits in digitList if (digitList.get(i-1).compareTo(digitList.get(i)) &gt;= 0){ return false; } else{ return true; } } } . 2019 FRQ 3B . Write the method isBalanced, which returns true when the delimiters are balanced and returns false otherwise. The delimiters are balanced when both of the following conditions are satisfied; otherwise, they are not balanced. 1. When traversing the ArrayList from the first element to the last element, there is no point at . which there are more close delimiters than open delimiters at or before that point. 2. The total number of open delimiters is equal to the total number of close delimiters. . | Consider a Delimiters object for which openDel is &quot;&quot; and closeDel is &quot;&quot;. The examples below show different ArrayList objects that could be returned by calls to getDelimitersList and the value that would be returned by a call to isBalanced. | . public boolean isBalanced(ArrayList&lt;String&gt; delimiters) { int open = 0; int close = 0; for (String d: delimiters) { if (d.equals(openDel)) { open++; } else if (d.equals(closeDel)) { close++; } if (close &gt; open) return false; } return open == close; } .",

Object-oriented programming, abbreviated as OOP, is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around objects | Object-oriented programming languages compartmentalize data and functions in such a way that data and the functions that operate on the data are bound together | .

Objects created under the same class will share common methods and attributes. | Objects are instances of a class. | Methods, otherwise known as functions, are a set of code that perform a specific task | . Classes and Objects . Classes in Java can contain data members, methods, constructors, nested classes, and interfaces. | An object is initialized by calling a class constructor.

Learning Objective Notes . Skill 1.B: Determine code that would be used to complete code segments (ie For, While, Recursion) This skill was used in this mini lab to implement the fibonacci algorithm with for loops, while loops, and recursion | Completed the assignment with different code segments and variations which extended the same method | . | . . Skill 4.C: Determine if two or more code segments yield equivalent results (be sure to Discuss how you know results are the same) From the outputs of these different implementations of the fibonacci algorithms, all code segments (stream, for loops, while loops, recursion) yield the same results | For this example of the Fibonacci code, I knew they will yield the same results because the only variations in the code are the one method. All other attributes and methods of the classes are inherited from the Fibo class and unchanged, thus they will yield the same results. I just changed the method to add another iterative loops/recursion. | . | . . Skill 5.A: Describe the behavior of a given segment of program code (describe the difference in recursion versus for &amp; while loops, perhaps add timing to determine speed) the recursion method should take the longest because it involves running the program an increasing # of times from 1-20 fibCalc() is repeatedly called (ie fibCalc(5) = fibCalc(4) + fibCalc(3) = fibCalc(3) + fibCalc(2) + fibCalc(2) + fibCalc(1)... and so on). In other words, as the number inputted into the fibonacci increases, so will the time it takes to run the code because each one will have to go further down in the sequence to eventually reach the final number. | . | .",

Object Oriented Programming Monkeys . I worked towards making the monkey in an OOP way, because the orignal way they were made were imperative . public class Monkey1 { String [][] monkey = new String[][]{ // 2D array above is just a name, &quot;new&quot; makes a container (&quot;object&quot;) //Monkey 1 { &quot; ʕ༼ ◕_◕ ༽ʔ&quot;, //[0][0] eyes &quot; _⎏_/ &quot;, // [0][1] chin &quot; ++1++ &quot;, // [0][2] body &quot; ⌋ ⌊ &quot; // [0][3] legs }, }; String eyes; String chin; String body; String legs; // determining the body parts public Monkey1() { eyes = monkey[0][0]; chin = monkey[0][1]; body = monkey[0][2]; legs = monkey[0][3]; } // outputting each body part by printing them public void getMonkey1(){ System.out.println(this.eyes); System.out.println(this.chin); System.out.println(this.body); System.out.println(this.legs); } } public class MonkeyLoop { public static void main(String[] args) { Monkey1 monkey1 = new Monkey1(); monkey1.getMonkey1(); } } MonkeyLoop.main(null); . ʕ༼ ◕_◕ ༽ʔ _⎏_/ ++1++ ⌋ ⌊ . Hack Questions . Is this program in more of an Imperative Programming Style or OOP style? Explain. Observe variable assignments. | Is each Monkey an object? | Build an where the monkey is an object versus two-dimensional array. This would be leading into Unit 5 requirements * | . | . . Study loops and zero based counting Study two-dimensional (2D) array references | Explain different way you can access a 2D array | . | . . This program is more of an Imperative Programming Style. This is because only one object is used and the creation of the program is primarily based on the code within one individual method. In other words, the variables and monkeys are assigned within the class and method, and are not unique to an object. | Each monkey is not an object, rather the monkeys are stored in the 2D array. | Monkey as an OOP Style is shown above | . . two-dimensional (2D) arrays are indexed by two subscripts, one for the row and one for the column | Each element in the 2D array must by the same type either a primitive type or object type. | . | you can access the 2D array by using the row index value and column index value: array_name[row_index][column_index]; | .",

We think life&#39;s circumstances matter a lot, but they don&#39;t matter as much as we think people do not think as much as we do | things like where we live, and what job we have do not matter in our happiness levels | people who focus on having money are oftentimes not happy later when they do have money | what we predict is going to make us happy, doesn&#39;t usually make us happy | . | Taking control of our life is oftentimes much harder than we think you can become happier, but it takes daily work and a lot of effort | &quot;It may be obvious that to achieve anything substantial in life, a good deal of effort is required. Research reveals that if you want to achieve happiness, you will need to go about it in a similar way&quot; | . | One of the hard you have to do when you begin this enterprise, is recognizing your intuition don&#39;t work your mind is lying to you a lot of the time | we can forecast things that are going to make us happy, and usually it does not make us as happy as we assume | one example of this: money and salary | . | Make time for social connection having a healthy mental health is very important | in order to do so, we should find time to have social connections with others | prioritize people that you care about in life | . | Always help others in any situation helping others help us more than we expect | very happy people give their time to others (much more powerful that doing things for yourself) | for example: instead of spending money for themselves, give it to other people | . | Make time for gratitude simple act of doing this is very powerful | think of the positives rather than focusing on the negatives of life | focus on the benefits (force yourself to do this --&gt; will make you happier) | write down everyday everything you are grateful for | . | Healthy practices matter a lot more than we think experiencing gratitude | be mindful in the moment (meditation) | taking time for sleep and exercise | . | It is very important to take time to be in the present moment most of us have trouble with this because we do not have time to realize that we are here | we do not think of all the small details about where we are, we do not live in the moment | . | .

            "title": "If Statement Lesson",
            "content": "If Statement . The Java If statement is the most simple decision-making statement | It is used to decide whether a certain statement or block of statements will be executed or not for example: if a certain condition is true then a block of statement is executed | . | . String letterGrade = &quot;A&quot;; if (letterGrade == &quot;A&quot;) System.out.println(&quot;Grade Value: 4.0&quot;); . Grade Value: 4.0 . If-Else Statement . If-Else statements execute a block of code if the condition is true, but another if the condition is false | In other words, to execute a different code block if the condition is false, we can use the Java else statement | . String dayOfWeek = &quot;Sunday&quot;; if (dayOfWeek == &quot;Saturday&quot; || dayOfWeek == &quot;Sunday&quot;) System.out.println(&quot;It is a weekend! :)&quot;); else System.out.println(&quot;It is a weekday :(&quot;); . It is a weekend! :) . If-Elseif-Else Statements . If-Elseif-Else statements provide multiple conditions of else-if statements in addition to the else statement | Else code block will execute if the specified conditions are all false | For Example: BMI Levels if BMI is under certain level, they will be told they are healthy | if BMI is over certain level, they will be told they are unhealthy | if not any of these, they are average level | . | . int BMILevel = 22; if (BMILevel &gt; 25) System.out.println(&quot;Unhealthy BMI Level - Too High!&quot;); else if (BMILevel &lt; 18) System.out.println(&quot;Unhealthy BMI Level - Too Low!&quot;); else System.out.println(&quot;Healthy BMI Level!&quot;); . Healthy BMI Level! . If-elseif-elseif-elsif-else Statement . These are multiple if-else statements that each display a value if the original value is not true | For example: GPA Calculator Each letter grade has an associated grade value, and when inputted with a certain letter grade, the code will excute through the if-else statements and find the correct value | . | . String letterGrade = &quot;A&quot;; if (letterGrade == &quot;A&quot;) System.out.println(&quot;Grade Value: 4.0&quot;); else if (letterGrade == &quot;B&quot;) System.out.println(&quot;Grade Value: 3.0&quot;); else if (letterGrade == &quot;C&quot;) System.out.println(&quot;Grade Value: 2.0&quot;); else if (letterGrade == &quot;D&quot;) System.out.println(&quot;Grade Value: 1.0&quot;); else if (letterGrade == &quot;F&quot;) System.out.println(&quot;Grade Value: 0.0&quot;); . Grade Value: 4.0 . Switch Cases . Switch Case Statements help simplify/manage the complexity of if else statements which can in many circumstance become overly long especially when comparing by a case by case basis | It also helps the code run at a more efficient pace by allowing it to not go through each if-else statement | It works by stating a variety of Case statements which all have conditions The code blocks under each case are then run if the condition to one of the cases is met | Just like if else statements, Switch Case statements will go down each case to see if a condition is met | . | . String letterGrade = &quot;C&quot;; switch(letterGrade){ case &quot;A&quot;: System.out.println(&quot;Grade Value: 4.0&quot;); break; case &quot;B&quot;: System.out.println(&quot;Grade Value: 3.0&quot;); break; case &quot;C&quot;: System.out.println(&quot;Grade Value: 2.0&quot;); break; case &quot;D&quot;: System.out.println(&quot;Grade Value: 1.0&quot;); break; case &quot;F&quot;: System.out.println(&quot;Grade Value: 0.0&quot;); break; default: System.out.println(&quot;Invalid Letter Grade Entered&quot;); } . Grade Value: 2.0 . De Morgans Law . De Morgan&#39;s Law states that in a boolean statement, the not operator ! will reverse all the operators in that statement | For instance, true becomes false, false becomes true, and becomes or, or becomes and, &gt; becomes &lt;=, &lt;= becomes &gt;, etc | . boolean x = true; boolean y = true; if (!(x &amp;&amp; y)){ System.out.println(&quot;x and y both are false!&quot;); } else{ System.out.println(&quot;x and y are true!&quot;); } if (!x || !y){ System.out.println(&quot;x and y both are false!&quot;); } else{ System.out.println(&quot;x and y are true!&quot;); } . x and y are true! x and y are true! .",

Presentation Homework . Question 2A . A set of classes is used to represent various items that are available for purchase. Items are either taxable or nontaxable. The purchase price of a taxable item is computed from its list price and its tax rate. The purchase price of a nontaxable item is simply its list price. Part of the class hierarchy is shown in the diagram below. Write the TaxableItem method purchasePrice. The purchase price of a TaxableItem is its list price plus the tax on the item. The tax is computed by multiplying the list price by the tax rate. For example, if the tax rate is 0.10 (representing 10%), the purchase price of an item with a list price of $6.50 would be $7.15. . public double purchasePrice(){ return (1 + taxRate) * getListPrice(); } . Question 3A . Consider the following incomplete class that stores information about a customer, which includes a name and unique ID (a positive integer). To facilitate sorting, customers are ordered alphabetically by name. If two or more customers have the same name, they are further ordered by ID number. A particular customer is &quot;greater than&quot; another customer if that particular customer appears later in the ordering than the other customer. . Write the Customer method compareCustomer, which compares this customer to a given customer, other. Customers are ordered alphabetically by name, using the compareTo method of the String class. If the names of the two customers are the same, then the customers are ordered by ID number. Method compareCustomer should return a positive integer if this customer is greater than other, a negative integer if this customer is less than other, and 0 if they are the same. For example, suppose we have the following Customer objects. Customer c1 = new Customer(&quot;Smith&quot;, 1001); Customer c2 = new Customer(&quot;Anderson&quot;, 1002); Customer c3 = new Customer(&quot;Smith&quot;, 1003); . public int compareCustomer(Customer other) { int nameCompare = getName().compareTo(other.getName()); if (nameCompare != 0) { return nameCompare; } else { return getID() - other.getID(); } } .",

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . The comment #hide_input was used to hide the code that produced this. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . . place a #collapse-output flag at the top of any cell if you want to put the output under a collapsable element that is closed by default, but give the reader the option to open it: . print(&#39;The comment #collapse-output was used to collapse the output of this cell by default but you can expand it.&#39;) .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code .
