    "A set of classes is used to represent various items that are available for purchase. Items are either taxable or nontaxable. The purchase price of a taxable item is computed from its list price and its tax rate. The purchase price of a nontaxable item is simply its list price. Part of the class hierarchy is shown in the diagram below. Write the TaxableItem method purchasePrice. The purchase price of a TaxableItem is its list price plus the tax on the item. The tax is computed by multiplying the list price by the tax rate. For example, if the tax rate is 0.10 (representing 10%), the purchase price of an item with a list price of $6.50 would be $7.15. "
