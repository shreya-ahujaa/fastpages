    "## Overall Reflection/Takeaways\n",
    "Overall, there was a lot to takeaway from this trimester. I learned a lot through the units of Collegeboard and the Project Based Learning and I think my team and I worked well together. We each had our own part, for example, I was the Scrum Master, but I think we did well in making sure we did all the parts. For next trimester, I think I could have better time management so that I can do the requirements and go above and beyond.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Based Learning\n",
    "PBL was a really good experience especially in understanding what is necessary for a website that would work well. I worked a lot as the Scrum Master, and I also helped with the Frontend so that I could learn the different aspects of code. Also I worked with the Backend during the individual sections so that I would learn that as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Fastpages\n",
    "Learning Fastpages helped develop my ability to blog my learning and developments. Fastpages itself was generally very easy to use to develop requiring the creation of notebooks or html/md files. It helped with taking notes and I think it was a good way to manage my code and notes at the same time. \n",
    "\n",
    "### AWS\n",
    "I thought learning how to use AWS was the most challenging for me. I learned how to do it through deploying my own website, and then when we assigned a AWS Manger (Aadya) then I had not done as much. Maybe next trimester I would be able to do more for AWS and deployment.\n"

    "\n",
    "-  We think life's circumstances matter a lot, but they don't matter as much as we think\n",
    "    - people do not think as much as we do\n",
    "    - things like where we live, and what job we have do not matter in our happiness levels \n",
    "    - people who focus on having money are oftentimes not happy later when they do have money\n",
    "    - what we predict is going to make us happy, doesn't usually make us happy\n",
    "- Taking control of our life is oftentimes much harder than we think\n",
    "    - you can become happier, but it takes daily work and a lot of effort\n",
    "    - \"It may be obvious that to achieve anything substantial in life, a good deal of effort is required. Research reveals that if you want to achieve happiness, you will need to go about it in a similar way\"\n",
    "- One of the hard you have to do when you begin this enterprise, is recognizing your intuition don't work \n",
    "    - your mind is lying to you a lot of the time \n",
    "    - we can forecast things that are going to make us happy, and usually it does not make us as happy as we assume\n",

    "   - simple act of doing this is very powerful\n",
    "   - think of the positives rather than focusing on the negatives of life\n",
    "   - focus on the benefits (force yourself to do this --> will make you happier)\n",

    "   - be mindful in the moment (meditation)\n",
    "   - taking time for sleep and exercise\n",
    "- It is very important to take time to be in the present moment\n",
    "   - most of us have trouble with this because we do not have time to realize that we are here\n",
    "   - we do not think of all the small details about where we are, we do not live in the moment\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Booleans and If Statements\n",
    "#### Boolean Expressions\n",
    "- all non zero numbers are true\n",
    "   - the most common example: 1 = true; 0 = false\n",
    "- == checks for comparison\n",
    "   - not to be confused with = which is assignment\n",
    "- != checks for inequality\n",
    "- <, >, >=, <=\n",
    "   - these operands do their normal functions\n",
    "- || relates to the or function\n",
    "- && related to and function\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Logic Gates\n",
    "- Buffer/YES : output is the same as the input\n",
    "- NOT : output is the opposite of the input\n",
    "- AND : returns true if both inputs are true\n",
    "- NAND : returns false if both inputs are true\n",
    "- OR : returns true if at least one of the inputs are true, returns false if both inputs are false\n",
    "- NOR : returns false if at least one of the inputs are true, returns true if both inputs are false\n",
    "- XOR : returns true if the two inputs are different\n",
    "- XNOR : returns true if two inputs are the same\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Truth Tables\n",
    "- A truth table is a breakdown of a logic function by listing all possible values the function can attain. Such a table typically contains several rows and columns, with the top row representing the logical variables and combinations, in increasing complexity leading up to the final function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Arrays Notes\n",
    "#### Vocabulary\n",
    "- Array: a type of data structure that contains a collection of data\n",
    "   - in Java, arrays and ArrayLists are different data structures\n",
    "   - the data in Java array can be primitive or referenced\n",
    "    - primitive: contain a single variable\n",
    "    - referenced: several variables of different types\n",
    "- Parts of an Array\n",
    "   - element: one value in array\n",
    "   - index: the position of the value in array\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6.1 Array Syntax\n",
    "- when you declare an array variable, it is not initialized\n",
    "   - by default, each element in the array is value 0\n",
    "- you can also specify the initial values in an array\n",
    "    - you don't need to use the new operator\n",
    "       - the compiler counts the number of initial values to determine the length of the array\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6.2 Traverse an Array\n",
    "- traversing an array is accessing the values inside of it\n",
    "- you can use any sort of loop to traverse an array\n",
    "    - recommend using for loops\n",
    "- you can also use for loops to traverse backwards through an array\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6.3 Enhanced For Loops\n",
    "- you can use a basic for loop to visit all elements of an array\n",
    "- use an enhanced for loop to visit all elements of the array\n",
    "   - read loop as \"for each element in values\" \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6.4 Developing ALgorithms Using Arrays\n",
    "- how to identify the minimum and maximum value inside an array \n",
    "- finding sums of arrays, finding eery other element int he array, check for duplicates\n",
    "- sorting arrays\n",
