    "## Introduction to ArrayLists\n",
    "- A reference type\n",
    "   - Mutable and contains object references\n",
    "- Array cannot be modified while ArrayLists can change their size dynamically\n",
    "- Syntax for Instantiation:\n",
    "   - ArrayList<String> cars = new ArrayList<String>();\n",
    "\n",
    "## ArrayList Methods\n",
    "-  add(int index, element): this method is used to add an element at a particular index in the list.\n",
    "- addAll(int index, Collection collection): this method is used to add all the elements in the given collection to the list.\n",
    "- size(): this method is used to return the size of the list.\n",
    "- clear(): this method is used to remove all the elements in the list.\n",
    "- remove(element or int index): this method removes an element from the specified index. \n",
    "- get(int index): this method returns elements at the specified index.\n",
    "- isEmpty(): returns true if the list is empty, else false.\n",
    "- sort(Comparator comp): this method is used to sort the elements of the list on the basis of the given comparator.\n",

    "## Developing Algorithms of ArrayLists\n",

    "## Searching\n",
    "- Searching \n",
    "   - The locating of data within linear structures (arrays, lists, queue, stack, etc.)\n",
    "   - Searching a structure involves control structures (we’ve already learned about them):\n",
    "   - Iteration and selection → loop with an if statement inside\n",
    "- For loops are optimal for linear searching because each element needs to be specified sequentially, with no need to track the index after it’s executed\n",
    "- If there’s a match, the index is printed out, otherwise, the search continues.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sorting\n",
    "- Sorting sorts the ArrayList in a specified order\n",
    "    - Ascending\n",
    "    - Descending\n"
