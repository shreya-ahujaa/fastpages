    "## Vocabulary\n",
    "- Array: a type of data structure that contains a collection of data\n",
    "   - in Java, arrays and ArrayLists are different data structures\n",
    "   - the data in Java array can be primitive or referenced\n",
    "    - primitive: contain a single variable\n",
    "    - referenced: several variables of different types\n",
    "- Parts of an Array\n",
    "   - element: one value in array\n",
    "   - index: the position of the value in array\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6.1 Array Syntax\n",
    "- when you declare an array variable, it is not initialized\n",
    "   - by default, each element in the array is value 0\n",
    "- you can also specify the initial values in an array\n",
    "    - you don't need to use the new operator\n",
    "       - the compiler counts the number of initial values to determine the length of the array\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6.2 Traverse an Array\n",
    "- traversing an array is accessing the values inside of it\n",
    "- you can use any sort of loop to traverse an array\n",
    "    - recommend using for loops\n",
    "- you can also use for loops to traverse backwards through an array\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6.3 Enhanced For Loops\n",
    "- you can use a basic for loop to visit all elements of an array\n",
    "- use an enhanced for loop to visit all elements of the array\n",
    "   - read loop as \"for each element in values\" \n",
    "\n",
    "## 6.4 Developing ALgorithms Using Arrays\n",
    "- how to identify the minimum and maximum value inside an array \n",
    "- finding sums of arrays, finding eery other element int he array, check for duplicates\n",
    "- sorting arrays\n",
    "- important things to know \n",
    "   - array.length: returns how many values are in the array\n",
    "   - array[i]: accesses the array at index i"
